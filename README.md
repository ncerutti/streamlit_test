# Practical Data Science at Data Science Retreat 
In this small project, I used [streamlit](https://docs.streamlit.io/) to make a front-end application for interaction with a deployed machine learning model. I also deployed it using streamlit cloud.

The application is a simple model to predict customer churn at a telecommunications company, using a dataset of [customer churn data](https://www.kaggle.com/code/mechatronixs/telco-churn-prediction-feature-engineering-eda/data) from Kaggle.

In the end, the application looks like this and allows for manual introduction of customer data:
